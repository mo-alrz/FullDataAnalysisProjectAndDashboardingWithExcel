Most used VBA Procedure is the Sub Procedure, This consists of a set of commands the code should execute

Sub my_macro()

End sub

Function Procedures are commands that create formulas, They return one value (or an array of values), They can be used
as “normal” formulas in Excel or inside other procedures

Function my_formula()

End function

CTRL + space -> Complete the word

VBA assigns color to keywords and capitalizes code references
Wrong use of code is shown as red
Comments (' at the beginning) are shown as green

Excel object's model: Application -> Workbooks -> (Workbook) -> Worksheets -> (Worksheet) -> Range

Property -> What an object has
Properties comes after the object hierarchy

Method -> What an object does
Methods can have additional information
Methods can change properties
Methods can have argument

Different Methods to Write to Cells
                                                        A      B       C       D       E       F
Range("A1").Value = "1st"                           1   "1st"
Range("A2:B2").Value = "2nd"                        2   "2nd"  "2nd"
Range("A3:C3, E3:F3").Value = "3rd"                 3   "3rd"  "3rd"   "3rd"           "3rd"   "3rd"
Range("A4,C4").Value = "4th"                        4   "4th"          "4th"
Range("A5", "C5").Value = "5th"                     5   "5th"  "5th"   "5th"
Range("A" & 6, "C" & 6).Value = "6th"               6   "6th"  "6th"   "6th"
Range("A4:C7").Cells(4, 2).Value = "7th"            7          "7th"
Range("A1").Offset(7, 2) = "8th"                    8                  "8th"
Range("A1:B1").Offset(8, 1) = "9th"                 9          "9th"   "9th"
Range("LastOne").Value = "10th"                    10   "10th"

Referencing Entire Rows / Columns


Rows("12:14").RowHeight = 30                            Rows 12, 13 & 14 have a row height of 30
Range("16:16,18:18,20:20").RowHeight = 30               Rows 16, 18 & 20 are changed. 17 & 19 are not touched.
Columns("E:F").ColumnWidth=10                           Columns E to F have a column width of 10
Range("H:H,J:J").ColumnWidth=10                         Columns H & J are changed. Column I is not touched.
Range(Columns(1), Columns(3)).ColumnWidth = 5           Columns A, B & C have column width of 5
Cells.Columns.AutoFit                                   All columns are adjusted by autofit

Methods to find the last Row/Column
Last row
Range("k6").Value = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
Range("k6").Value = Range("A4").End(xlDown).Row
Range("k11").Value = Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell).Row
Range("k12").Value = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count

Last Column
Range("k8").Value = Cells(4, Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column

Current Region Address
Range("k9").Value = Range("A5").CurrentRegion.Address

Current Region Rows Number
Range("k10").Value = Range("A5").CurrentRegion.Rows.Count

Variables And Data Types
Data Type                Memory used                         Range
Byte                     1 byte                              0 to 255
Integer                  2 bytes                       -32,768 to 32,768
Long                     4 bytes                -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
Boolean                  2 bytes                          True / False
Double                   8 bytes                Very large negative to positive
                                            range with high precision (also used for %)
String                   1 byte per char                Depends on length
Object                   4 bytes                            Any object
Date                     8 bytes                     01,1,0100 to 12,31,9999
Currency                 8 bytes                Very large negative to positive
                                                 range up to 4 decimal places
Variant                  16 bytes           Any value –can also hold values such as
                                                 “Empty”, “Nothing” and “Null”

Declaring Variables, Arrays and Constants
Declaring variables by defining a suitable data type has the outcome:
1. Your code will run faster 2. Your code will be less prone to mistakes

Dim my Text As String
Dim LastRow As Long, FirstRow as Long

A group of similar variables that has one name can be declared as an Array

Dim myMonth(1 To 12) As String

If you need to refer to a value that never changes, you can use Constants

Const myScenario As String = "Actual"
Const ProfitCen As Long = 9999

Variables can also hold objects. Common objects are:

1. Workbook Object          Dim NewBook As Workbook
2. Worksheet Object         Dim NewSheet As Worksheet
3. Range Object             Dim NewRange As Range

To assign variables to objects, you need to use the SET statement

Set NewBook = Workbooks.Add

All "usual" VBA assignments are actually done with the LET statement. However this is an optional keyword. That's why
it's usually not used. In case you come across it, you know what it does.

LastRow = Rows.Count - is the same as Let LastRow = Rows.Count
